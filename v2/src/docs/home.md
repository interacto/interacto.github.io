## What is Interacto?

Interacto is a front-end framework for processing user interface events.
With Interacto developers handle user interactions (DnD, drag-lock, double-click, button click, pan, multi-touch, etc.) instead of low-level UI events.
Developers configure how to turn a selected user interaction into a (undoable) UI command using a fluent API.

Interacto is both implemented in Typescript and Java. The Typescript implementation is the current focus of development
and will be the main focus of this documentation, but both implementations are fairly similar.
