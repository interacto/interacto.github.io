## What is Interacto?

Interacto is a front-end framework for processing user interface events.
With Interacto developers handle user interactions (DnD, drag-lock, double-click, button click, pan, multi-touch, etc.) instead of low-level UI events.
Developers configure how to turn a selected user interaction into a (undoable) UI command using a fluent API.

Interacto is both implemented in TypeScript and Java (JavaFX). The TypeScript implementation will be the main focus
of this documentation, but both implementations are fairly similar. While most of the documentation will assume
that you are using Angular with the TypeScript implementation of Interacto, Interacto can also be used with
Vue.js or React.
